Arduino powered LED Christmas Tree

Using an Arduino board, I was able to utilize several strands of LED chrismtas lights and built a tree for my yard.

Inventory
-1 Yellow strand for the star
-8 green strands for the tree
-2 white strands for the northpole
-2 red strands for the north pole

The code cycles through several "scenes" which turn on and off the pins on the arduino board.   The pins control relays which turn the 120v pover on and off for the lights.
